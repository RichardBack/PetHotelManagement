# Intent: The intent is to provide pet details in a clear, structured, and well-organized
# format, that showcases personal and cost information for each pet
# retrieved form the database. The approach prioritizes readability and improves the
# user experience when reviewing or managing pet records.

# Decisions: The decision is to implement a convenient and structured solution for retrieving
# and displaying pet information from a database. The script leverages the 'fetch_all_pets' functions
# to retrieve data, formats it with ANSI color codes for visual clarity, and presents the information
# in an organized easy to read and understand layout.

# display.py or main.py
from db_operations import fetch_all_pets  # Import the fetch function
import mysql.connector  # Optional: If you need database interaction here
