## 🌟 Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**

The **Pet Hotel Management System** is one of my key projects that showcases my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. It started as a **Java-based system** and evolved into a **Python-based solution** for managing both dogs and cats.

### Key Highlights:
- **Java Implementation**: Developed core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` to manage pet information.
- **Python Adaptation**: Transitioned the system to Python, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Used advanced data structures like `Node` and `PetLinkedList` for efficient pet record management.
