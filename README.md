# Hi, I'm Richard! 👨‍💻 Computer Scientist and Programmer

Welcome to this ePortfolio! This showcases a **Computer Science graduate** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, with expertise in programming, problem-solving, and software engineering. Below is an overview of key skills, projects, and insights.

## 📚 About

A strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and coding has been built throughout the Computer Science journey. Focus is on creating efficient, scalable software solutions while adapting to new programming languages.

## 🌟 Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**

The **Pet Hotel Management System** is a key project highlighting skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. Initially developed as a **Java-based system**, the project has evolved into a **Python-based solution** to manage both dogs and cats.

### Key Highlights:
- **Java Implementation**: Core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` were developed to manage pet information.
- **Python Adaptation**: The system was transitioned to Python, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Advanced data structures, such as `Node` and `PetLinkedList`, were used for efficient pet record management.
