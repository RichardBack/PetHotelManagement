# Hi, I'm Richard! üë®‚Äçüíª Computer Scientist and Programmer

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am a **Computer Science graduate** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, with expertise in programming, problem-solving, and software engineering. Below is an overview of key skills, projects, and insights.

## üìö About Me

As a Comuter Science graduate, I have built a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and coding. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable software solutions while adapting to new programming languages.

## üåü Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**

The **Pet Hotel Management System** is a key project highlighting skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. Initially developed as a **Java-based system**, the project has evolved into a **Python-based solution** to manage both dogs and cats within **MySQL** database. This transition enables more efficient data handling and interaction with the database, leveraging Python's flexibility alongside MySQL's robust relational database management capabilities. The system maintains essential functionalities such as check-in/check-out processes, pet-specific services, and a structured database for storing information on each pet.

### Key Highlights:
- **Java Implementation**: Core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` were developed to manage pet information.
- **Python Adaptation**: The system was transitioned to Python, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Advanced data structures, such as `Node` and `PetLinkedList`, were used for efficient pet record management.
