# Hi, I'm Richard! 👨‍💻 Computer Scientist and Programmer

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am a **Computer Science graduate** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, with expertise in programming, problem-solving, and software engineering. Below, you'll find an overview of my skills, projects, and reflections.

## 📚 About Me

As a Computer Science graduate, I've built a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and coding. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable software solutions and adapting to new programming languages.

## 🌟 Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**

The **Pet Hotel Management System** is one of my key projects that showcases my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. It started as a **Java-based system** and evolved into a **Python-based solution** for managing both dogs and cats.

### Key Highlights:
- **Java Implementation**: Developed core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` to manage pet information.
- **Python Adaptation**: Transitioned the system to Python, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Used advanced data structures like `Node` and `PetLinkedList` for efficient pet record management.

## 🎯 Key Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Software Engineering**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Design Patterns
- **Database Management**: SQL, Data Structures
