# Hi, I'm Richard! 👨‍💻 Computer Scientist and Programmer

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am a **Computer Science graduate** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, with expertise in programming, problem-solving, and software engineering. Below is an overview of key skills, projects, and insights.

## 📚 About Me

As a Computer Science graduate, I have built a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and coding. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable software solutions while adapting to new programming languages.

## 🌟 Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**

The **Pet Hotel Management System** is a key project highlighting skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. Initially developed as a **Java-based system**, the project has evolved into a **Python-based solution** to manage both dogs and cats within a **MySQL** database. This transition enables more efficient data handling and interaction with the database, leveraging Python's flexibility alongside MySQL's robust relational database management capabilities.  
The system maintains essential functionalities such as:
- **Check-In/Check-Out Processes**
- **Pet-Specific Services**
- **Structured Database Management**

### Key Highlights:

- **Java Implementation**: Developed core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` to manage pet data.
- **Python Adaptation**: Transitioned the system to Python, enhancing code readability and scalability.
- **Database Integration**: Incorporated advanced data structures like `Node` and `PetLinkedList` for dynamic pet record management.
