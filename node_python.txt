# Intent: The intent is to define a basic structure for a linkedlist, where each node stores
# data and references the next node, enabling a dynamic sequence of elements

# Decisions: The decision is to create a Node class that stores data and includes a pointer
# to link to the next node in a linkedlist. Initially, the pointer is set to None, indicating
# either the end of the list or an unconnected state

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        # Initialize a Node with data and pointer to the next node
        self.data = data  # Store node data
        self.next = None  # Initialize the next pointer to None
