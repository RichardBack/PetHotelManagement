# Intent: The intent is to manage and display detailed information about pets
# in a boarding facility, that includes duration of stay, grooming services is needed,
# owner information. This is done using and object-oriented approach for clarity and
# modularity

# Decisions: The decision is to create a scrip that instantiates pet objects (cats and dogs)
# with specific attributes, stores them in a list, and displays their information using
# the 'print_pet_information function. This method organizes and presents pet data efficiently
# for easy access and viewing
