        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Richard, a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University. With a passion for coding, I have acquired a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and software development. Over the years, I have gained experience in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, focusing on creating efficient and optimized solutions.</p>
        <p>During my time at SNHU, I completed multiple projects that allowed me to develop not only my technical skills but also my ability to collaborate with teams, manage time effectively, and adapt to new technologies. My goal is to continually learn and apply new concepts to real-world problems.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic background, I am passionate about tech entrepreneurship and have plans to leverage my skills to develop innovative tech solutions. I look forward to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with others in the tech community.</p>

        <!-- Dogs Cats Hotel Enhancement Section -->
    <section class="dogs-cats-hotel">
        <h2>The Dogs Cats Hotel Enhancement</h2>
        <p>The original Pet Hotel Management system was enhanced by renaming it to The Dogs Cats Hotel. I transitioned the existing Java code to Python, modernizing the system and optimizing the codebase. A key enhancement was the integration of MySQL, which allows efficient storage and retrieval of pet and owner data, enabling real-time management of reservations, check-ins, and check-outs.</p>
        <p>The transition to Python ensured smoother operations and scalability, while the database integration streamlined data handling for the pet hotel. The focus was on creating a pet and owner-friendly experience, making the interface intuitive for staff and ensuring seamless communication between pet owners, their pets, and the hotel staff.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python, MySQL, Data Structures, GitHub Design.</p>

        <h2>Category One: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
        <p>The artifact chosen for category one, Software Engineering and Design, is IT-145 Foundation in App Development. Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG) is developing software tailored to manage operations for dogs. The goal is to replace the outdated paper-based processes with efficient digital solutions. The system now handles essential functions such as dog check-in and check-out, pet management tasks, feeding schedules and yard times, and administrative features, including updating pet information and tracking payment statuses. It includes specialized capabilities like managing specialized services, available exclusively for pets staying two days or more. The software streamlines operations within the boarding facility, ensuring smooth processes from arrival to departure for all pet guests.</p>

            <h3>Enhancements to The Pet Hotel Management System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming Principles:</strong> Subclassing 'Dog' and 'Cat' from the base 'Pet' class demonstrates proficiency in inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This ensures organized, reusable, and scalable code.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Adaptability:</strong> Transitioning the system from Java to Python underscores adaptability and language proficiency, involving the translation of syntax, data structures, and handling mechanisms across programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Hierarchies Design:</strong> Designing class hierarchies for different pet types, ensuring the system is flexible and extensible with tailored behavior for dogs and cats, while maintaining a cohesive architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintainability and Extensibility:</strong> The system was designed with a modular architecture, ensuring it can be maintained and extended easily with new features or changes in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Debugging Skills:</strong> Rigorous testing practices were followed to ensure functional correctness and resolve issues arising from the transition between programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation and Communication:</strong> Clear documentation and communication of technical decisions demonstrate the ability to convey complex concepts and solutions to stakeholders and team members, an essential aspect of software development.</li>
            </ul>
