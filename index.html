        <h2>Category One: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
        <p>The artifact chosen for category one, Software Engineering and Design, is IT-145 Foundation in App Development. Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG) is developing software tailored to manage operations for dogs. The goal is to replace the outdated paper-based processes with efficient digital solutions. The system now handles essential functions such as dog check-in and check-out, pet management tasks, feeding schedules and yard times, and administrative features, including updating pet information and tracking payment statuses. It includes specialized capabilities like managing specialized services, available exclusively for pets staying two days or more. The software streamlines operations within the boarding facility, ensuring smooth processes from arrival to departure for all pet guests.</p>

    <h2>Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>The artifact chosen for category two is IT-145 Foundation in App Development. The focus was on the implementation of algorithms to handle pet scheduling efficiently. A priority queue algorithm was implemented to manage reservations, giving precedence to pets with urgent needs or longer stays. Linked lists were used to track pets' daily activities dynamically. These improvements resulted in more efficient resource allocation and better scheduling management for the staff and pets at the hotel.</p>

<section class="category" id="category-three">
    <h2>Category Three: Databases</h2>
    <p>The chosen artifact for category three focuses on database integration. The transition to MySQL allowed seamless management of reservations, check-ins, and check-outs. A normalized database structure was designed to prevent redundancy and improve data integrity. The integration ensured real-time updates, enabling the staff to retrieve and manage data effectively. Furthermore, indexing strategies were used to enhance the performance of queries, resulting in faster operations even during peak hours.</p>

    <h2>The Dogs Cats Hotel Enhancement</h2>
    <p>The original Pet Hotel Management system was enhanced by renaming it to The Dogs Cats Hotel. I transitioned the existing Java code to Python, modernizing the system and optimizing the codebase. A key enhancement was the integration of MySQL, which allows efficient storage and retrieval of pet and owner data, enabling real-time management of reservations, check-ins, and check-outs.</p>
    <p>The transition to Python ensured smoother operations and scalability, while the database integration streamlined data handling for the pet hotel. The focus was on creating a pet and owner-friendly experience, making the interface intuitive for staff and ensuring seamless communication between pet owners, their pets, and the hotel staff.</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python, MySQL, Data Structures, GitHub Design.</p>
