# Intent: The intent is to define a 'Pet' class to store and display
# pet details, including information about hte pet, owner, boarding, and
# grooming if needed

# Decisions: The decision was to create a 'Pet' class that is structured
# with an '__init__' method for pet attributes and a 'get__pet_info' method that
# returns a formatted string of the pet's details

from datetime import datetime  # Import datetime for date formatting
